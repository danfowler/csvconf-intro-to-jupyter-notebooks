    "**Facilitator**: Dan Fowler, Developer Advocate at [Open Knowledge International](https://okfn.org/)\n",

    "**Venue**: [csv,conf,v3](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon 2-3 May 2017\n",

    "**Description**: Jupyter Notebooks are a convenient way to experiment, share code and context, and collaborate on data analysis.  This session is part of Data Tables.  It is an introduction to the use of Jupyter Notebooks inspired by [Micheleen Harris's talk last year](https://csvconf.com/2016/#mharris) at csv,conv,v2 ([slides here](https://github.com/michhar/csvconf2016)).  \n",

    "- Introduce and motivate Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Help install on attendees' systems\n",
    "- Walk through basic usage\n",

    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Jupyter (formerly IPython) Notebook is a way of packaging code, images, rendered graphs, and commentary in a convenient, sharable format.  \n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks allow users to share analysis in a visually rich way.  \n",
    "  - You can share the generated `*.ipynb` file.  GitHub will also automatically render uploaded notebooks (see [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/))\n",
    "- Code is interactive and executable\n",
    "  - Executed code cells (including simple variables) render output (if any) directly to the notebook\n",
    "  - Code and rendered output is stored in a notebook file (`introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks.ipynb`)\n",
    "- Default language supported is Python\n",
    "  - Additional language support provided by *kernels* (50+)\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will load csv,conf,v2 and csv,conf,v3 speakers CSV files in separate code cells using pandas.  We will also scrape csv,conf,v1 speaker information from the website.  This should show how easy it is to perform basic data processing tasks with Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows this \"cell\" (the basic unit of a Jupyter Notebook) is another cell containing executable Python code.  After clicking within, shift+enter executes and renders the output in space below."
